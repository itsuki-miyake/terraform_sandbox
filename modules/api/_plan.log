> terraform plan



Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 <= read (data resources)

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.project-factory.module.budget.data.google_project.project[0] will be read during apply
  # (depends on a resource or a module with changes pending)

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
