> terraform plan



Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # module.project-iam-bindings.google_project_iam_binding.project_iam_authoritative["default--roles/admin"] will be created
  + resource "google_project_iam_binding" "project_iam_authoritative" {
      + etag    = (known after apply)
      + id      = (known after apply)
      + members = [
          + "user:user01@sample.com",
        ]
      + project = "xxx"
      + role    = "roles/admin"

Plan: 5 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
